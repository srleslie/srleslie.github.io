Hi! I'm Leslie, a digital IC design engineer at Arm China. My current job is mainly focused on the design of Arm architecture CPU cores, especially debug system and performance analysis infrastructure. I'm also pretty familiar with digital signal processing and SoC design.

I received my M.A. of EECS at the East China Normal University, and my B.A. at the Xi'an University of Technology.
